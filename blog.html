                        <p>DeomX1 is a fully autonomous quadcopter developed by Drone Dio for the SUAS 2025 competition. The system is designed to perform complex aerial missions with high reliability, precision, and autonomy. With a strong focus on waypoint navigation, real-time object detection, and payload delivery, DeomX1 is engineered for full mission compliance using a modular, field-adaptable architecture.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/deomx1_side.png" alt="DeomX1 3D Model Side View">
                        <p>At the heart of DeomX1 lies the NVIDIA Jetson Orin 16GB, which executes YOLOv5-based object detection pipelines in real-time. The Orin coordinates directly with the SpeedyBee F405 V4 flight controller, ensuring smooth integration between high-level autonomy and low-level control logic.</p>
                        
                        <p>The aircraft features a 3D-printed modular payload system, capable of accurate beacon drops with minimal mechanical complexity. A lightweight carbon fibre frame was chosen for its rigidity, weight efficiency, and structural integrity. Communication is achieved through a secure 4G LTE VPN link, allowing real-time video and telemetry streaming to the ground control station.</p>

                        <h3>Tested and Proven</h3>
                        <p>DeomX1 has undergone extensive testing across three levels: component validation, subsystem integration, and full mission simulation. It has demonstrated consistent performance across waypoint execution, object detection, and controlled payload deployment — all within SUAS specification limits.</p>
                        
                        <p>This system represents Drone Dio's commitment to innovation, safety, and mission-readiness.</p>
